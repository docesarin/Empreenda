# Empreenda - Price Calculator

This project is a personal challenge focused on developing a price calculator for small business owners. It is divided into three parts, each with a specific objective for improvement and growth.

## 1. **Basic Version - Terminal**

The first part of the project is a simple script that runs in the terminal. It performs essential calculations for small business owners, such as price calculation, profit margin, break-even point, net profit, and annual profit. The goal of this version is to provide a quick and straightforward solution without the need for a graphical interface.

## 2. **Intermediate Version - Graphical Interface**

The second part, still under development, will introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user interaction. This version aims to make the calculator more intuitive and visually appealing, enabling users to input data and view results more easily.

## 3. **Advanced Version - Additional Features**

The third part of the project will focus on adding advanced features, such as database integration to store calculation history, generating financial reports, and visualizing data through performance analysis graphs. This phase aims to make the tool more comprehensive and valuable for business owners.
